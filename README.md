# App Deployer

A lightweight developer tool built with [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/) to simplify **server-side app deployment workflows**.  

App Deployer provides:
- A **filesystem picker** with neon-dark UI for selecting root, app, code, backup, and archive folders.
- A **nuclear wipe** function to safely and instantly clear selected directories before redeploy (avoids leftover contamination).
- **GitHub integration**: fetch branches from a repo, pick one, and clone it directly into your selected target directory.
- A unified **dark dashboard** with modular sections for Filesystem, Source Control, Services, and IIS.

---

## Features

### Filesystem Management
- Interactive folder pickers with dialogs (bound to global `State`).
- Root-aware browsing that ensures all other pickers open under the chosen root path.
- One-click wipe (`üí£`) using PowerShell `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force`.
- Dedicated inputs for:
  - Root folder
  - App folder
  - Code folder
  - Backup folder
  - Archive folder

### Source Control
- Input any public GitHub repo (full URL or `owner/repo`).
- Fetch available branches via the GitHub API.
- Select and clone a branch into your target directory (`git clone` via subprocess).
- Integrated branch selector + ‚ÄúClone‚Äù button.

### UI
- Built with [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/).
- Dark mode with neon green theme.
- Custom banners and section headers for a clean dashboard experience.
